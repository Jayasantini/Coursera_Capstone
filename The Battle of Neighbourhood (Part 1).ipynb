    "I am doing part-time business in selling customised arts such as graphite sketches, charcoal portraits, and acrylic paintings. I have set up a mini studio in my own room which is now becoming less cozy due to the increased customer’s demands and lack of space. I have decided that it is time to look for a rental space to set up my own studio. Since I have decided to have my own studio, I have planned to do art workshops or classes to school students as well."
